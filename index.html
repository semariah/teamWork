          <p> Hello <span class="name"> </span> you are being haunted by a ghost! We surmise that based on the awful fact that your birthday is <span class="birth"> </span> that you will be taken over by ghosts within the next 24 hours.

          <h3> Get married as soon as possible</h3>
          <h5 class="story3">Hello <span class="name"></span>. It looks like you are mostly not haunted based on the asnwers you provided us. Since you said you were born on <span class="birth"></span> and the name of your ugly cat is, <span class="cat"></span>  we kinda think that you are not close to be attacked by ghosts. But that is not yet the overall conclusion, because on the other side you also said that your zodiac sign is <span class="zodiac"></span> and the <span class="camp"></span> you want to be murdered is such a good combination to ghosts to completly abandon you and not haunt you. It is all because, you are easy to be haunted with just a small effort of your favorite evil foce <span class="evil"></span>. So do not panic, you will be haunted anyway, It's too late to worry now. what you could do just to be safe is, to get married at this old haunted house. The photo is just a reminder. I wrote this, cause I am practising sarcasm with friends.</h5><br>
          <h5>Yours truly,</h5>
          <h5>Least worried about your haunting, Semhar.</h5><br>
